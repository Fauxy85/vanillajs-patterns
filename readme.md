# What’s wrong with using frameworks and libraries, react etc?

Frameworks are a crutch and you need to keep updating them. No one likes that. Plus they all have extra things you need to learn. You can do everything you need with vanilla JS. This way you know exactly what is happening, you can see exactly how the router works (< 100 LoC). Good luck, trying to change anything with the routing system and react.

# What is your motivation?

The motivation is, I never need to rewrite these things. These vanilla.js patterns are much more flexible and can be modified without having to work within the framework, conventions and restrictions. Also, if something was wrong, you’re not dependent on the framework authors. You can fix it yourself. You are removing some of the risk of using a framework.

# Are you not reinventing the wheel?

It's more like removing the fluff. You learn and take back control. The wheel is the web browser.

# What’s wrong with using a CSS preprocessor like Sass?

CSS is a simple and powerful language. You don’t need a preprocessor. You can do everything you need with vanilla CSS, especially with the new features like nesting. You can even nest media queries.
